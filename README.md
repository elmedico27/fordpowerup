<h2>Ford Power-Up Version History</h2>

The version history of the Ford Power-Up updates for the Ford SYNC Version 4 and 4a hardware developed by Ford Motor Company began with the release of the 2021 Mustang Mach-E in December 2020. This was simply referred to as over-the-air (OTA) updates until May 2021 when Ford adopted the "Ford Power-Up" name.

## Overview

The Ford Power-Up updates have the ability to upgrade the user interface as well as reprogram module firmware within the vehicle. Ford expects to produce 33 million vehicles with Power-Up capability by 2028. Not all vehicles have the same software layout due to the differences in the user interfaces. SYNC 4 comes with an 8 or 12 inch horizontally oriented main display while SYNC 4a comes with a 12 or 15.5 inch vertically oriented main display.

## BlueCruise

The current version of BlueCruise is v1.5, released in October 2024.  Currently only 2025 Mustang Mach-E vehicles will have BlueCruise 1.5, though Ford indicates other model years may eventually receive it.  

- BlueCruise v1.5 features:
  - Automatic lane change
- BlueCruise v1.4 features:
  - Greater in-lane stability with less ping-ponging
  - Automatic speed adjustment through more curves
- BlueCruise v1.3 features:
  - Fewer disengagements through curves and narrow lanes
- BlueCruise v1.2 features:
  - Lane Change Assist (change lanes with a tap of the turn signal)
  - Predictive Speed Assist (adjust vehicle speed for road curves, roundabouts and more)
  - In-Lane Repositioning (helps hands-free highway driving feel more natural by keeping the vehicle in its lane while subtly shifting its position away from vehicles in adjacent lanes, especially large semi trucks)

<!-- Commenting out "Future Features" section since several have been implemented and I'm not sure the others are accurate

## Future features

Ford has publicly discussed enhancements for future Power-Up updates. The precise timing and grouping of these updates has not been announced. These features may be released across several versions, and some or all of these features may not be released for certain vehicles, model years, or at all.

These future features include:

- Access to Tesla Supercharger network (V3 and V4 Superchargers only) - enabled February 29, 2024 with adapter shipments beginning April 2024
- Karaoke Mode - available since 10.1.0
- Touchscreen Games
  - “Escape Room”
- Pet Mode

## Versions

The following table summarizes the release history for the Ford SYNC Version 4 and 4a Power-Up software updates, from version 4.x onward.  Updates prior to this can be found on the [Pre-4.x Versions](Archive.md) page.

**Important Note**: Ford Power-Up updates may not apply to all model years, nor are they sequential.  Release notes may also change mid-rollout.  The list below is *generally* in order of appearing in the wild, but this is not reflective of the order they are delivered to vehicles or that they will even be released to a particular vehicle.  I try to keep this limited to over-the-air updates, but some of the information below comes from FDRS sources.

Take a look at what we've done.**<br> <br>*Easy on the eyes*<br>You may have noticed that things look a little different on your vehicle screen today. That's because we're continuing to improve the modern design to make it simple to navigate and find what you're looking for. A few changes you'll notice include a smaller top bar and we've moved some icons to make it easier to view. A dedicated user profile button has even been added.<br> <br>*Step up to the mic, please*<br>For this latest Ford Power-Up software update, we listened to your feedback and made it easier for you to continue to share your experiences by recording and sending voice feedback from the convenience of your vehicle. Prior to this update, access for this feature was in the Settings-General menu. But now it's been moved to the App screen and will be available whenever your vehicle is activated in FordPass. Look for the new Record Feedback microphone icon — and continue to let us know what you really think.<br> <br>*No need to sound the alarm*<br>This update will allow you to easily turn the motion sensor alarm OFF from the vehicle settings screen or alert POPUP. That means when you have a passenger or pet inside, they can move around while you do the same outside.  | APIM                                    |                                |
